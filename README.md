# Fork
The sole purpose of this fork is to change the colors of the font and the background to make the resulting pdf easier on 
the eyes (for me, personally) - black foreground, white background.

In order to build:
```shell
xelatex graypaper.tex
biber graypaper
xelatex graypaper
xelatex graypaper
```
